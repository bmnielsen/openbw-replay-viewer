# openbw-replay-viewer
Standalone copy of the OpenBW replay viewer webpage (originally/normally hosted at http://www.openbw.com/replay-viewer).

Available on GitHub Pages at https://bmnielsen.github.io/openbw-replay-viewer.

## Source of the assets

All of the asset files were taken from an [archived version of the OpenBW website](https://web.archive.org/web/20240116231013/http://www.openbw.com/replay-viewer/) on archive.org from January 16th 2024.

## Local development

Included are a simple Dockerfile and build-and-run script that can be used to serve the static files on http://localhost:8888. It doesn't have anything fancy like hot reloading, so if you want to do some real development work on it I would suggest adding a proper frontend build pipeline.
